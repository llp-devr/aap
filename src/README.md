AAP is a project developed for learning purposes, aimed at creating automation
tasks for lawyers using the PJe (Processo Judicial Eletrônico) platform.

## About PJe

PJe is an electronic judiciary system developed by CNJ (Conselho Nacional de
Justiça) in Brazil. It provides a digital platform for managing legal proceedings,
allowing lawyers, judges, and other legal professionals to handle cases and access
relevant information online.

## Project Overview

The AAP project aims to explore and understand the functionalities of the PJe
platform while developing automation tasks. By leveraging the PJe APIs and other
relevant technologies, we seek to simplify and streamline common legal processes,
ultimately benefiting legal professionals and improving their productivity.

## Goals

- Develop automation tasks to simplify legal processes for lawyers.
- Explore the integration of additional technologies to enhance the project's
capabilities.
- Create a user-friendly and intuitive interface for managing automation tasks.
